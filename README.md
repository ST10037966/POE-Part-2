# POE-Part-2
A Recipe Application 
For Part 2 of my POE, there have been a few changes to my application, firstly I have added an Ingredient() class as well as a RecipeManager() class. The application will perform the same functions as in part one with a few slight changes. The application works the same in the sense that you use a menu to select which function you would like to use. You are now able to enter an unlimited number of recipes, and they get stored, and when desired â€“ it will display in alphabetical order. The user will then be able to display which recipe he/she chooses. Each ingredient now has an option to enter the calories and food group, and each recipe you can now do a calorie count and the application will provide a warning for if the calorie count exceeds 300.
